This repository contains several projects developed as part of my activities during the Formulatrix bootcamp program. The workspace includes multiple .NET projects showcasing different aspects of C# and ASP.NET Core development.

## Projects Overview

### 1. hello-world

A simple console application that outputs "Hello, World!" to the console. This represents the first step in learning C# programming.

### 2. learn-csharp

A console application that demonstrates the following C# concepts and features.

### 3. logic-exercise

A console application that implements the classic "FizzBuzz" programming challenge. The program prints numbers from 1 to 15, replacing multiples of 3 with "foo", multiples of 5 with "bar", and multiples of both with "foobar".

A RESTful API built with ASP.NET Core and PostgreSQL, demonstrating:

- Entity Framework Core with PostgreSQL
